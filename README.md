# magic black box

## overview

The Magic Black Box (MBB) is an exploratory project aimed at wireless technology and homemade sensors. The black box has an on/off switch, and when you turn it on, it broadcasts a WiFi network. The code for the ESP32 inside the MBB is in this repo, as well as the code which receives the sensor data over WiFi and generates visuals based on the 



## wiring diagram



## getting started

- construct the box according to the included photos and wiring diagram
- flash the esp32 with the included arduino code
- turn the box on and connect your computer to the broadcasted network
- run the included processing sketch while connected to the esp32's network
